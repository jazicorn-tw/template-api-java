# ⚡ Environment Variables — Quick Reference (CI & Remote)

This section is a **high-signal index** of environment variables that apply to
**CI and remote (non-local) environments only**.

Detailed behavior, gating rules, and rationale live in the linked specs.

---

## 🔀 CI Feature Flags (GitHub Actions)

```text
# Release control (disabled by default — must opt in)
ENABLE_SEMANTIC_RELEASE   # true|false — allow semantic-release execution on main
                          # (manual workflow_dispatch may override per run)

# Artifact publishing (disabled by default — must opt in)
PUBLISH_DOCKER_IMAGE      # true|false — enable Docker image publishing (after a release)
PUBLISH_HELM_CHART        # true|false — enable Helm chart publishing

# Safety / scope
CANONICAL_REPOSITORY      # <owner>/<repo> — only repo allowed to publish artifacts

# Release artifact guard (enabled by default — set to 'false' to disable)
GUARD_RELEASE_ARTIFACTS   # false — disable CHANGELOG.md authorship enforcement

# CI job/step feature flags (enabled by default — set to 'false' to skip)
ENABLE_STATIC_ANALYSIS    # false — skip Checkstyle/PMD/SpotBugs in CI Quality
ENABLE_SONAR              # false — skip Sonar cache + analysis in CI Quality
ENABLE_MD_LINT            # false — skip markdown-lint job in CI Quality
ENABLE_DOCTOR_SNAPSHOT    # false — skip doctor snapshot job

# Deployment (future)
DEPLOY_ENABLED            # true|false — global deployment kill switch
```

📄 See:

- `ENV_SPEC_CI.md`
- `CI_FEATURE_FLAGS.md`
- `../devops/RELEASE.md`

## 🧪 CI Runtime (GitHub Actions)

Variables provided automatically by GitHub Actions during workflow execution.

```text
CI                    # true — set automatically by CI runners
GITHUB_ACTIONS        # true — GitHub Actions environment
GITHUB_REF            # branch or tag ref
GITHUB_REF_NAME       # short ref name
GITHUB_SHA            # commit SHA
GITHUB_REPOSITORY     # owner/repo
```

📄 See: `ENV_SPEC_CI.md`

---

## ☁️ Hosted Runtime Platforms (Render / AWS / Cloud)

Variables injected by managed hosting platforms.

```text
PORT         # platform-provided port (e.g. Render)
RENDER       # true — Render environment indicator
AWS_REGION   # AWS region (if applicable)
```

📄 See: `PLATFORM_NOTES.md`

---

## 🗄️ Managed Databases (Remote)

Remote databases are always external to the application process.

```text
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME
SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD
```

📄 See: `DATABASE_POSTGRESQL.md`

---

## 🔐 Secrets (Remote-only)

Secrets are injected via platform secret managers and must never be logged.

```text
JWT_SECRET
DATABASE_PASSWORD
GH_APP_PRIVATE_KEY
GHCR_TOKEN
```

📄 See:

- `ENV_SPEC_CI.md`
- `SECURITY_AUTH.md`

---

## 🩺 Observability / Health

Health and probe configuration used by platforms and orchestrators.

```text
MANAGEMENT_ENDPOINT_HEALTH_PROBES_ENABLED
MANAGEMENT_ENDPOINTS_WEB_EXPOSURE_INCLUDE
MANAGEMENT_ENDPOINT_HEALTH_SHOW_DETAILS
```

📄 See: `OBSERVABILITY_LOGGING.md`

---

## Notes

- **CI feature flags** are configured in **GitHub Actions → Variables**
- **Release and publish behavior is job-level gated**
- **Publishing is blocked** for non-canonical repositories
- **Remote runtime variables** are injected by hosting platforms
- **Secrets are never committed** — use platform secret managers only
- Defaults are **fail-closed** where applicable

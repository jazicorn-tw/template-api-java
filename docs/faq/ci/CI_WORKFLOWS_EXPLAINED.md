# What does each CI workflow do?

This article describes every GitHub Actions workflow in this project — when it
runs, what it checks, and what can skip or gate it.

---

## Workflow overview

| --- | --- | --- |
| `ci.yml` | CI | All PRs, push to `main`/`staging`, manual |

## ci.yml — CI

**Triggers:** all PRs, push to `main`/`staging`, `workflow_dispatch`

Four parallel / sequenced jobs:

1. **`test`** — compile + `./gradlew test` with Testcontainers (requires Docker).
   - Docker sanity check (`docker version` / `docker info`)
   - Full `act` + Testcontainers compatibility env vars
   - Jacoco: coverage report + **70% line coverage minimum** enforced via
     `jacocoTestCoverageVerification` (build fails below threshold)
   - SonarCloud: `./gradlew jacocoTestReport sonar` — gated by
     `ENABLE_SONAR != 'false'`; requires `SONAR_TOKEN`; skipped under `act`.
     DTOs, exceptions, config, and migrations are excluded from coverage metrics.
   - Uploads test report artifact on failure

2. **`quality`** — Spotless + static analysis (no Docker, no Sonar, runs in
   parallel with `test` for fast feedback)
   - `spotlessCheck`
   - `checkstyleMain/Test`, `pmdMain/Test`, `spotbugsMain/Test` — gated by
     `ENABLE_STATIC_ANALYSIS != 'false'`

3. **`markdown-lint`** — runs `markdownlint-cli2 '**/*.md'` independently;
   gated by `ENABLE_MD_LINT != 'false'`

4. **`planning-lint`** — needs `test`; lints `IDEAS.md`, `TODO.md`, and
   `PROMOTION_CHECKLIST.md` using `scripts/planning/planning-lint.sh`

Named `"CI"` so that `pr-helper.yml` (`workflow_run: workflows: ["CI"]`)
correctly receives failure events and posts helper comments on PRs.

---

## release.yml — Release

**Triggers:** PRs targeting `main`/`staging`/`canary`, push to those
branches, tag push `v*.*.*`, `workflow_dispatch`

Three jobs, each with its own `if:` condition and minimal `permissions:`:

1. **`docker-build`** — Docker build check, no push; runs on PRs and branch
   pushes (skipped on tag push). Permissions: `contents: read`

2. **`helm-lint`** — `helm lint helm/app`; same trigger as `docker-build`.
   Permissions: `contents: read`

3. **`release`** — semantic-release; runs only on push to `main`/`canary` or
   manual dispatch, gated by `ENABLE_SEMANTIC_RELEASE=true`. Permissions:
   `contents: write`, `issues: write`, `pull-requests: write`, `packages: write`
   - GitHub App token via `tibdex/github-app-token`
   - Dry-run preview → publish (dry-run only under `act`)
   - Writes job summary with gate values and outcome

> Artifact publishing (Docker + Helm) is handled by `publish.yml` — see below.

See [`WHY_NO_RELEASE.md`](./WHY_NO_RELEASE.md) for the full release diagnosis
guide.

---

## publish.yml — Publish

**Triggers:** tag push `v*.*.*`

Two independent jobs, each gated by its own feature flag:

1. **`docker`** — builds and pushes the Docker image to GHCR; gated by
   `PUBLISH_DOCKER_IMAGE=true` + `CANONICAL_REPOSITORY` match.
   Permissions: `contents: read`, `packages: write`
   - Tag strategy: stable `v1.2.3` → `1.2.3`, `1.2`, `1`, `latest`;
     canary `v1.2.3-canary.1` → `1.2.3-canary.1`, `canary`
   - Builds `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` (Apple Silicon native)

2. **`helm`** — packages and pushes the Helm chart as an OCI artifact to
   `ghcr.io/<owner>/charts`; gated by `PUBLISH_HELM_CHART=true` +
   `CANONICAL_REPOSITORY` match.
   Permissions: `contents: read`, `packages: write`

Kept separate from `release.yml` to avoid a `needs`-chain skip: when
triggered by a tag push, `release.yml`'s `release` job is skipped, which
caused a `publish` job inside `release.yml` to be skipped even with
`always()` in its `if` condition.

---

## security.yml — Security

**Triggers:** all PRs, push to `main`/`staging`, weekly schedule (Monday
03:00 UTC), `workflow_dispatch`

**Gated:** skipped when `ENABLE_CODEQL=false` or when running under `act`.

Single job:

- Initializes CodeQL for `java-kotlin` with the `security-and-quality` query
  suite
- Builds the project via CodeQL autobuild (no Docker required)
- Uploads results as SARIF to the **Security → Code scanning** tab
- On PRs: posts (or updates) a summary comment with the issue count and a link
  to the Security tab; uses an idempotent marker so the comment updates in place

The weekly schedule catches new vulnerability rules published between pushes.

**To disable:**

```text
Settings → Variables → Actions → ENABLE_CODEQL = false
```

---

## changelog-guard.yml — Changelog Guard

**Triggers:** all PRs and all pushes (no branch filter)

Prevents manual edits to `CHANGELOG.md`. Rules:

- **PRs** — any PR that modifies `CHANGELOG.md` fails
- **Pushes to non-`main` branches** — modification blocked
- **Pushes to `main`** — allowed only if the commit message matches
  `chore(release): X.Y.Z [skip ci]` and the author is a recognized bot

Can be disabled via `GUARD_RELEASE_ARTIFACTS=false` (repo variable).

---

## pr-helper.yml — PR Helper

**Triggers:** after a workflow named `"CI"` completes with a non-success result
on a pull request

Posts (or updates) a single comment on the PR linking to the First PR Smoke
Test checklist. Uses an idempotent marker so the comment is updated in place
rather than duplicated on every failure.

This workflow does not run any tests. It only writes a comment.

---

## doctor.yml — Doctor

**Triggers:** all PRs, push to `main`, `workflow_dispatch`

Runs `scripts/doctor.sh --json --allow-ci` and validates the output:

- Checks required JSON fields: `status`, `os`, `git_branch`, `java_major`,
  `docker_provider`, `warnings`, `errors`
- Fails if `status=fail`
- Emits GitHub annotations for each warning and error
- Uploads `build/doctor/doctor.json` as a build artifact (14-day retention)

Can be disabled via `ENABLE_DOCTOR_SNAPSHOT=false` (repo variable).

## Feature flags summary

Most workflows respect repository variables that let you disable expensive or
optional steps. See
[`docs/environment/ci/CI_FEATURE_FLAGS.md`](../../environment/ci/CI_FEATURE_FLAGS.md)
for the complete list.

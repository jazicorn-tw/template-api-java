# ✅ Conventional Commits Cheat Sheet (1 page)

Use this project’s commit format:

```text
<type>(optional scope): <description>
```

Examples:

- `feat(trades): add accept trade endpoint`
- `fix(db): handle null resource id`
- `docs(onboarding): clarify doctor vs verify`
- `chore(ci): tighten release artifact guard`
- `refactor(service): extract trade validation`
- `test(api): add trade rule coverage`
- `build(gradle): pin spotless version`

---

## 🚀 Recommended workflow

Create commits interactively:

```bash
cz commit
```

This helps you pick the right type and keeps messages consistent.

### Committing with a multi-line message in VSCode

For longer commit messages with a body, open your editor instead of writing inline:

```bash
# One-time setup — set VSCode as your git editor
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"

# Then commit without -m to open the editor
git commit
```

Git opens `.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG` in VSCode. Write your message, save, and close the tab.
VSCode's Source Control panel (`⌃⇧G`) also lets you stage individual files or hunks before committing.

## ✅ Types (what to use)

| Type       | When to use it               | Release signal |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| `feat`     | New user-facing capability   | **minor**      |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                      | **patch**      |
| `docs`     | Docs only                    | none           |
| `test`     | Tests only                   | none           |
| `refactor` | No behavior change           | none           |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement      | patch/minor*   |
| `build`    | Build tooling / dependencies | none           |
| `ci`       | GitHub Actions / CI changes  | none           |
| `chore`    | Maintenance / housekeeping   | none           |
| `revert`   | Revert a commit              | depends        |

\* depends on analyzer rules; default is usually patch if it’s a fix-like change.

## 💥 Breaking changes (pre-1.0)

This project is currently `0.x`.

Use `!` for breaking changes:

```text
feat!: change API contract
```

Or add a footer (also counts as breaking):

```text
BREAKING CHANGE: describe what changed and why
```

> Note: breaking changes trigger a major version bump. The planned `v1.0.0` release
> is Phase 7 (JWT auth enforcement) — the first intentional, roadmap-defined breaking change.
> See [`docs/phases/ROADMAP.md`](../phases/ROADMAP.md) for details.

---

## 🧠 Scopes (optional but helpful)

Good scopes: `api`, `service`, `domain`, `db`, `security`, `ci`, `docs`, `build`

Example:

```text
fix(security): require auth for trade accept
```

---

## ✍️ Style rules

- Use **imperative** mood: “add”, “fix”, “update” (not “added”, “fixed”)
- Keep the subject **short** (≈ 50 chars is a good target)
- **No period** at the end of the subject line
- Explain “why” in the body if needed

Body example:

```text
feat(trades): add accept endpoint

Includes validation for ownership and availability.
Adds integration tests using Testcontainers.
```

---

## ⚠️ Releases are CI-owned (important)

Avoid local release commands like:

```bash
cz bump
cz changelog
```

Releases (versions, tags, `CHANGELOG.md`, GitHub Releases) are handled by **semantic-release in CI**.
PRs that modify release artifacts (like `CHANGELOG.md`) may be rejected by CI guards.

---

## 🔎 Quick self-check

Before pushing:

```bash
make quality
```

Before opening a PR:

```bash
make verify
```

---

## 🧩 If your commit gets rejected

- Run `cz commit` instead of `git commit`
- Fix the message to match the schema
- If formatting tools changed files (Spotless), re-stage and re-commit:

  ```bash
  git add -A
  git commit -m "your message"
  ```

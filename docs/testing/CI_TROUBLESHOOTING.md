# Troubleshooting Guide

> PostgreSQL + Docker + Colima + Testcontainers + Ryuk

This project uses **Testcontainers** to start a **PostgreSQL** container for integration tests.
This document is the **single source of truth** for diagnosing local failures.

## TL;DR – Quick Fix

```bash
docker ps
```

If this fails, Docker/Colima is not running.

```bash
unset DOCKER_HOST
docker context use colima
colima start
./gradlew cleanTest test
```

If you see:

```bash
Mapped port can only be obtained after the container is started
```

You are mixing Testcontainers strategies.
This project uses **classic Testcontainers only**.

## How Tests Are Wired (Authoritative)

- JUnit 5 + `@Testcontainers`
- Static `@Container` PostgreSQL container
- Datasource injected via `@DynamicPropertySource`
- Spring Boot **does not** manage the container lifecycle
- Flyway runs automatically against the container database

❌ `@ServiceConnection` is **not allowed**

## Docker / Testcontainers Failures

If tests fail due to Docker not being available, this is expected behavior.

This project does not support in-memory databases for tests.

Related decisions:

- [ADR-001](../adr/ADR-001-database-postgresql.md): Use PostgreSQL across all environments
- [ADR-002](../adr/ADR-002-testcontainers.md): Use Testcontainers for integration tests

## Viewing HTML Test Reports

When a test fails, Gradle generates detailed **HTML reports** that often contain
more information than the console output (especially for Spring context
`initializationError`s).

### Location

From the project root:

```bash
build/reports/tests/test/
```

Per-test-class reports live under:

```bash
build/reports/tests/test/classes/
```

Example:

```bash
build/reports/tests/test/classes/com.{{app-name}}.platform.PlatformApplicationTest.html
```

---

### macOS (recommended)

Open the report directly in your default browser:

```bash
open build/reports/tests/test/classes/com.{{app-name}}.platform.PlatformApplicationTest.html
```

---

### Finder

1. Open the project directory
2. Navigate to:

   ```text
   build → reports → tests → test → classes
   ```

3. Double-click the `.html` file for the failing test

---

### VS Code

1. Press **⌘ + P**
2. Paste the path:

   ```bash
   build/reports/tests/test/classes/com.{{app-name}}.platform.PlatformApplicationTest.html
   ```

3. Press Enter  
   (VS Code will open it or offer to open it in a browser)

---

### What to Look For

In the HTML report, scroll to the **stacktrace** section and focus on:

- The **first `Caused by:`** line with an actual message
- Errors mentioning:
  - `DataSourceAutoConfiguration`
  - `Testcontainers`
  - `Mapped port`
  - `ConditionEvaluationReport`

These lines explain *why* the test failed and are more reliable than the
high-level Gradle output.

> If the console output is unclear, the HTML report is the source of truth.

## Java Test Runner Notes

VS Code's Java Test Runner may execute tests outside Gradle.
To avoid Mockito dynamic-agent warnings during local development,
we enable:

-XX:+EnableDynamicAgentLoading

Gradle and CI already preload Mockito as a Java agent and do not rely
on dynamic attachment.

## Recommended Test Profile

`src/test/resources/application-test.properties`

```properties
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate
spring.flyway.enabled=true
logging.level.org.hibernate.SQL=debug
```

❌ Do not hardcode datasource credentials.

---

## When Asking for Help

Include:

```bash
docker ps
docker context show
echo $DOCKER_HOST
colima status
```

And:

```bash
./gradlew test --stacktrace --info
```

Paste the **first `Caused by:` block**.
